ACT IV.

SCENE I.
<h4 class="PHILAMINTE name">PHILAMINTE</h4> <h4 class="ARMANDE name">ARMANDE</h4>


<h4 class="ARMANDE name">ARM</h4> <p class="ARMANDE speech">Yes, there was no hesitation in her; she made a display of her
obedience, and her heart scarcely took time to hear the order. She
seemed less to obey the will of her father than affect to set at
defiance the will of her mother.</p>

<h4 class="PHILAMINTE name">PHI</h4> <p class="PHILAMINTE speech">I will soon show her to which of us two the laws of reason
subject her wishes, and who ought to govern, mother or father, mind or
body, form or matter.</p>

<h class="ARMANDE name">ARM</h4> <p class="ARMANDE speech">At least, they owed you the compliment of consulting you; and
that little gentleman who resolves to become your son-in-law, in spite
of yourself, behaves himself strangely.</p>

<h4 class="PHILAMINTE name">PHI</h4> <p class="PHILAMINTE speech">He has not yet reached the goal of his desires. I thought him
well made, and approved of your love; but his manners were always
unpleasant to me. He knows that I write a little, thank heaven, and
yet he has never desired me to read anything to him.</p>




SCENE II
<h4 class="ARMANDE name">ARMANDE</h4> <h4 class="PHILAMINTE name">PHILAMINTE</h4> <h4>CLITANDRE</h4> <p class="direction">(_entering softly and
listening unseen_)</p>

<h4 class="ARMANDE name">ARM</h4> <p class="ARMANDE speech">If I were you, I would not allow him to become Henriette's
husband. It would be wrong to impute to me the least thought of
speaking like an interested person in this matter, and false to think
that the base trick he is playing me secretly vexes me. By the help of
philosophy, my soul is fortified against such trials; by it we can
rise above everything. But to see him treat you so, provokes me beyond
all endurance. Honour requires you to resist his wishes, and he is not
a man in whom you could find pleasure. In our talks together I never
could see that he had in his heart any respect for you.</p>

<h4 class="PHILAMINTE name">PHI</h4> <p class="PHILAMINTE speech">Poor idiot!</p>

<h4 class="ARMANDE name">ARM</h4> <p class="ARMANDE speech">In spite of all the reports of your glory, he was always cold in
praising you.</p>

<h4 class="PHILAMINTE name">PHI</h4> <p class="PHILAMINTE speech">The churl!</p>

<h4 class="ARMANDE name">ARM</h4> <p class="ARMANDE speech">And twenty times have I read to him some of your new productions,
without his ever thinking them fine.</p>
